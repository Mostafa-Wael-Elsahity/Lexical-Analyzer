# C++ Lexical Analyzer for C Code

## Overview

This C++ project implements a simple lexical analyzer for the C programming language. The lexical analyzer breaks down a stream of C code into various token classes, including keywords, identifiers, operators, numeric constants, character constants, string literals, special characters, comments, whitespace, and newline characters.

## Features

- Tokenizes C code into different categories for further processing.
- Handles keywords, identifiers, operators, numeric constants, character constants, string literals, special characters, comments, whitespace, and newline characters.
- Outputs the identified tokens along with their types and lexemes.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-lexical-analyzer.git
   cd cpp-lexical-analyzer ```

## Run and Build

g++ lexical_analyzer.cpp -o lexer
./lexer
